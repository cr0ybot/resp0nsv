Responsive Design View for Chrome (obsolete)

This is an old project that was meant to be a Firefox Responsive Design View clone for Chrome, before Chrome had a RDV. I recommend using Chrome's built-in "device mode" which does all this and more, like emulating touch events.

Also, there are some issues with cross-site scripting since I used an iframe to display the requested website.
